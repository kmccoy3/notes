# Introduction to MATLAB


### Introducing and Opening MATLAB

Favorite MATLAB functions:

* life
* penny
* loadhandel; sound(y,fs)
* logo

Weird Ones:
* rlcgui
* knot
* lorenz
* makevase
* truss
* vibes

### Big picture

We can solve problems!
* Computer programming allows us to solve problems over and over
* Computers can repeat and solve problems

Why do we learn MATLAB?
* useful to solve engineering problems
* great way to learn abstraction

`Abstraction`
* solving a problem in a generic sense
* identifying the steps to take you from what you know to what you want to know

* Reusing code with different inputs to solve many problems

### MATLAB Interface

* Command Window
  * A `variable` is a storage of data
  * Assignment operator `=` assigned value to variable
  * Semi-colon `;` suppressed output
  * Built-in functions (i.e.cosd, round, pi)
    * These functions have already been “defined”
* Current Directory
  * Important that current directory is set to the directory your files are in.
* Workspace
  * Check the workspace for the variable values, not the command window.
* Editor
  * red error underlining - highlighted code will cause an error
  * yellow error underlining - suggestions for better / quicker code
