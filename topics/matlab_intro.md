Introducing and Opening MATLAB
•Tips to succeed in 1371
•Favorite MATLAB functions:why, xpbombs, spy, fifteen, life, penny, loadhandel; sound(y,fs), logo

•Weird Ones -rlcgui, knot, lorenz, makevase, truss, vibes

•Start with a big picture – We can solve problems, computer programming allows us tosolve problems over and over•Computers can repeat and solve problems•Why do we learn MATLAB?

2 reasons,–useful to solve engineering problems–great way to learn abstraction

•Abstractionis solving a problem in a generic sense - identifying the steps to take youfrom what you know to what you want to know

•Reusing code with different inputs to solve many problems•MATLAB can be downloaded from OIT, please direct all issues with downloading toOITMATLAB Interface

•Command Window–What is a variable–Assignment operator–Semi-colon and other math operators–Built-in functions (i.e.cosd, round, pi)

∗These functions have already been “defined”
∗How to assign the output of a built in function4


∗What the phrase “call” means•Current Directory–Importance that current directory is set to the directory their files are in.

–Good practice to create a folder for each week’s HW and stay in that folder whileworking on that HW assignment

•Workspace–Importance to check the workspace for the variable values, not command window.

–Show them how to set the class bar on the workspace, so they can see the datatype of a variable.

•Editor–Saving Files–Talk about difference between red error underlining and yellow error underliningOpening/Solving Homework

•Go through the steps of downloading/solving a homework file and submitting it•Download week 1 homework and walk them through the first problem!

*everything  from  here  down  will  be  covered  in  moredepth next week, so try not to overwhelm them

*Functions

•What is a function, why do we need them?•Black box metaphor•Built in functions:  pieces of code that have already been coded and we can run fromany folder•We can write functions just like the built in ones•What is a.m file?


•EXAMPLE: In math, we sayy=f(x).  That is, given some input,x, we have somerelationship defined,f, that can give us our respective output,y.  

So we defineyinterms ofx, likey=x/3 + 1

Defining vs.  Calling•When we want to use a function, we “call” it.

•When we want to write a new function, we need to “define” it (i.e.  what we do forhomework drill problems in this class)

•Valid function headers vs.  Invalid function headers - a few rules (will appear on test!!):

–Brackets around multiple outputs–Parentheses around input(s)

–Inputs comma-separated–Never put any literal values, such as numbers.•Give examples of when we would use:

–Multiple outputs–Multiple inputs–No outputs–No inputs

•Talk about how function file name MUST be same as function name
